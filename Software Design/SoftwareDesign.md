# Things to Consider When Designing Software

When designing software, there are a few key considerations that should always stay in the back of your mind.  
Good design isn’t just about making something *work*—it’s about making it *sustainable*.  
(However, sometimes you really do just need to make something “work.”)

Below is a series of steps and guiding principles I follow when designing software.  
Think of this as a **living document**—it will grow over time as I refine my approach.

---

## 1. MVP — Minimum Viable Product

Before over-engineering or adding flashy features, start with the *core purpose*.

- **Functionality:** In its most basic form, what does this software *do* for the user—and does it do that well?  
- **Scope:** What is the *minimum* tech stack or system architecture needed for version 1?  
- **Privacy:** Have I covered all data security and privacy requirements?  
- **Scalability:** Can the app grow without massive rework?  
- **Design Consistency:** Is the UI/UX consistent across the system?  
- **Version Control:** Have I followed my Git standards, or do I need to clean the repo before continuing?

> *Focus on clarity, purpose, and maintainability first. Fancy features come later.*

## 2. API — Application Programming Interface

Your API is the connective tissue between systems. It should make life easier—not harder.

- **Documentation:** Is the API documented well enough that someone else could use it tomorrow?  
- **Utility:** Does it actually solve a problem or reduce complexity?  
- **Necessity:** Should I build this myself, or use an existing API?  
- **Consistency:** Are my endpoints and naming conventions uniform and intuitive?

> *A clean API is a contract between logic and usability.*

## 3.  Libraries — Use, Don’t Depend

Libraries are tools, not crutches.

- **Bloat Check:** Am I relying on too many third-party packages?  
- **Purpose Review:** Why is each library here—what problem does it solve?  
- **Skill Growth:** Am I using it because I can’t yet build that functionality myself?  
- **Design Impact:** Does it restrict my architecture or dictate how I design?

> *Choose libraries that empower design, not those that control it.*

---

## 4. Architecture — Building the System Itself

Architecture defines how your system *thinks*. It’s the skeleton beneath the surface.

- **Structure:** Does the project have clear boundaries (frontend, backend, database, etc.)?  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Are modules and services doing one thing well?  
- **Extensibility:** Can new features be added without breaking existing ones?  
- **Environment Parity:** Can I replicate production locally without “it only works on my machine” issues?  
- **Testing:** Do I have a plan for automated tests, mocks, and CI/CD pipelines?

> *Architecture is invisible when it’s done right—but it’s what holds everything together.*

## 5. Design Principles — Writing Better Code

Software design principles turn *clever code* into *clean code*. These are the core ideas I’ll explore further:

### SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility — A class or function should do one thing and do it well.  
- **O**pen/Closed — Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
- **L**iskov Substitution — Subtypes should work anywhere their parent type is expected.  
- **I**nterface Segregation — Don’t force objects to implement methods they don’t use.  
- **D**ependency Inversion — Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

### DRY / KISS / YAGNI
- **DRY:** *Don’t Repeat Yourself* — Abstract shared logic instead of copying it.  
- **KISS:** *Keep It Simple, Stupid* — Complexity is the enemy of maintainability.  
- **YAGNI:** *You Aren’t Gonna Need It* — Don’t build what you don’t yet need.

> *Principles are there to simplify decision-making, not to overcomplicate it.*

## 6. UX & Human Factors

The user doesn’t care how elegant your code is—they care how it feels to use.

- **Empathy:** Who is this built for, and what problem are they actually trying to solve?  
- **Cognitive Load:** Is the interface simple, predictable, and easy to learn?  
- **Feedback Loops:** Does the system clearly communicate success, failure, and progress?  
- **Accessibility:** Can people with different abilities use this effectively?

> *Good design disappears—it becomes invisible through ease of use.*

---

## 7. Security & Ethics

Every piece of software carries ethical responsibility.

- **Data Handling:** Am I storing or transmitting sensitive data securely?  
- **Permissions:** Does the app follow the principle of least privilege?  
- **Transparency:** Do users understand what data is being collected and why?  
- **Integrity:** Would I still stand by this system if my name were attached to it publicly?

> ⚖️ *Build software you’d be proud to defend in front of your users.*

---

## 8. Iteration & Reflection

No design is ever final—it’s an ongoing conversation between you and your software.

- **Post-Mortems:** What went wrong in the last version, and why?  
- **Feedback:** How can I gather meaningful input from users and peers?  
- **Refactoring:** What can I simplify or automate next time?  
- **Documentation:** Am I keeping track of architectural decisions and design rationales?

> *The best engineers aren’t those who never fail—they’re the ones who learn fast.*
