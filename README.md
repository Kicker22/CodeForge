# DSA Visual Learning Lab

This is a personal learning project to help me **master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** by combining **visual intuition** with **in-depth code implementations**.

The project includes:
- **JavaScript** files to **visualize** how different DSA structures and algorithms work
- **Python** files to **explore logic deeply** and get hands-on with low-level details

---

##  Goals

- Build deep intuition for how DSA structures behave internally
- Visualize dynamic operations step-by-step (e.g. insertions, deletions, traversals)
- Practice implementing key algorithms from scratch
- Create a personal reference library to revisit concepts later

## Project Structure

Each DSA topic has its own directory. Inside, you'll find:
