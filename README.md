## Snippets Overview

### 1. HTML Login Form
#### Structure
A basic login form containing inputs for username and password, along with a submit button.

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure `label` tags are properly associated with inputs.
- Include `aria-labels` or `aria-describedby` for screen readers.

---

### 2. Responsive Navigation Bar
#### Basic Structure
An HTML unordered list styled with CSS to create a horizontal navigation bar.

#### Media Queries
- Adjust layout for smaller screens using CSS media queries.
- Example: Convert to a dropdown menu for mobile devices.

---

### 3. Dynamic JavaScript Form Validation
#### Validation Rules
- Check for required fields.
- Validate email format and password strength.

#### Error Handling
- Display user-friendly error messages.
- Highlight invalid fields.

---

### 4. REST API Endpoint with Node.js and Express
#### Setting Up Express
- Install `express` using npm.
- Initialize a basic Express application.

#### Example Routes
- Example: GET `/users` to fetch user data.
- Example: POST `/login` to authenticate a user.

---

### 5. Database Connection Using MongoDB
#### Installing Dependencies
- Install `mongoose` via npm for database operations.

#### Connection Example
- Connect to a MongoDB database using a URI.
- Handle errors and successful connections.

---

### 6. Authentication with JWT
#### Generating Tokens
- Use the `jsonwebtoken` library to generate JWTs upon successful login.

#### Verifying Tokens
- Validate JWTs in protected routes to ensure authenticated access.

---

### 7. Frontend Fetch API Example
#### Fetching Data
- Use the `fetch` API to retrieve data from a REST API.

#### Handling Responses
- Parse JSON responses and update the UI dynamically.

---

### 8. CSS Grid-Based Layout
#### Grid Structure
- Define a grid container and grid items.
- Use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`.

#### Responsive Adjustments
- Adjust grid layout for different screen sizes using media queries.

---

### 9. React Component for a Contact Form
#### Form State Management
- Use React's `useState` hook to manage form inputs.

#### Handling Submissions
- Use `onSubmit` to handle form submission and send data to the server.

---

### 10. Basic Deployment with Docker
#### Writing a Dockerfile
- Define a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- Include steps to install dependencies and run the application.

#### Running the Application in a Container
- Build and run the Docker image locally.
- Push the image to a container registry for deployment.
